            <p class="main__p">IT was nearly a clean sweep for Liverpool in the men’s categories at the FIFA’s “The Best” Awards in Milan last night. <br>

            For the main award, Virgil van Dijk was denied by <span class="names">Lionel Messi</span> – which must have been an odd feeling for both as it was the other way round at Anfield in May – but <span class="names">Jürgen Klopp</span> won the Best Coach, while the Best Goalkeeper prize went to none other than Alisson Becker. Or at least it did once he came back from the men’s room. <br>
            
            There was a suspicion when The Reds forked out a then world-record fee for a keeper in the summer of 2018 that Alisson would be a game changer. He certainly was, and his new hobby of picking up best goalie awards is further proof of that, on top of his part in winning the <strong>Champions League</strong> last season. <br>
            
            The Brazilian rightly got as much credit as anyone for turning Liverpool from very good into great last year, and it was therefore perceived to be a heart-stopping disaster when he went down with a calf injury just minutes into the opening game of the new campaign. <br>
            
            Imagine if, in the minutes following the trophy parade in June, someone put the following question to you. “If Liverpool couldn’t play Alisson for the first 10 games or so of the season, who would you feel comfortable replacing him with?” <br>
            
            Other than the obvious answer of “I wouldn’t, I’d just go and have a big cry”, you would think the replies would range from Ederson, to Jan Oblak, or maybe Marc Andre ter Stegen.</p>
